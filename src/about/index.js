        Hello, I'm Mohammad, and I'm on a journey to become a software engineer. With a strong foundation in technical support and a passion for coding, I've embarked on a path to transform my career and make a meaningful impact in the world of technology.

        Over the past 6+ years, I've had the privilege of working in technical support roles at companies ranging from industry giants like Microsoft to innovative startups like Color and Rollbar. This experience has not only sharpened my problem-solving skills but has also given me a unique perspective on the intersection of customer-centricity and technology.

        I've always been drawn to the world of coding and software development. The idea of creating solutions that empower individuals and organizations drives me. My journey as a self-taught software engineer has been both challenging and rewarding. It has taught me the importance of continuous learning, adaptability, and resilience.

        As I work toward my goal of becoming a software engineer, I am passionate about harnessing the power of technology to build innovative solutions, whether it's crafting elegant code, developing user-friendly applications, or tackling complex technical challenges. I thrive on the excitement of learning new languages, frameworks, and tools, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

        This self portfolio serves as a showcase of my technical skills, projects, and achievements. I invite you to explore my journey, discover my work, and join me as I continue to grow and evolve as a software engineer. Together, let's shape the future through code and creativity.

        Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, collaborators, and mentors on this incredible adventure.
